	version: daemontools 0.60, alpha.
19990825
	portability problem: some systems need sys/time.h, not just
		time.h, before sys/resource.h. impact: couldn't compile.
		fix: change time.h to sys/time.h in softlimit.c. tnx Jos
		Backus and Chris Johnson.
	portability problem: echo -n echoes literal -n under traditional
		System V. tnx Tim Goodwin. impact: rts mismatch. fix:
		echo | tr -d.
	doc: removed note on man pages in conf-home. tnx Mate Wierdl.
	ui: do pidchange() and announce() before opening supervise/ok in
		supervise.c.
19990826
	version: daemontools 0.61, alpha.
20000304
	internal: upgraded to latest installation system.
	internal: switched from substdio to buffer.
	internal: switched from execvp to pathexec.
	internal: miscellaneous cleanups.
	internal: sped up tai64n.
	ui: svscan sleeps only 5 seconds.
	ui: svscan chdirs to argv[1] if argv[1] is supplied.
	ui: supervise does exec without waiting 1 second in child; but
		it waits 1 second before continuing in parent.
	ui: svstat reports time since last supervise pid change.
	ui: added envdir.
	ui: incorporated setlock from serialmail.
20000305
	internal: switched to new sig library.
	internal: switched to iopause.
	internal: more cleanups.
	internal: sped up multilog.
	ui: multilog sets current to mode 644 on restart.
	version: daemontools 0.70, beta.
20000315
	internal: new iopause.
20000316
	internal: supervise does announce() only after changing state.
		avoids disk writes when supervise is idle.
20010707
	internal: added const at various places.
	internal: miscellaneous cleanups.
	portability problem: with recent versions of glibc, and on AIX,
		including sys/time.h doesn't define struct tm. impact:
		couldn't compile. fix: also include time.h. tnx many
		people.
	portability problem: although sleep() isn't interrupted by
		signals on my old BSD/OS development machine, it is
		interrupted by signals on all new systems. impact: if a
		supervised process dies quickly (but not too quickly),
		supervise's 1-second sleep is interrupted, and the
		process is restarted immediately. fix: new deepsleep().
	internal: switched signal handling in supervise and multilog
		to blocked-by-default.
	ui: multilog accepts ALRM to immediately rotate all cyclic logs
		for which current is nonempty. tnx Peter Samuel and
		William E. Baxter.
20010708
	portability problem: under System V, one process can hold many
		exclusive locks on one file. impact: no impact on normal
		use, but some of the setlock regression tests fail. fix:
		change the tests to invoke an intermediate sh. tnx Mads
		Eilertsen.
	internal: fitfiles() in multilog.
	ui: added readproctitle.
	ui: added svscanboot. tnx Matthias Andree.
	ui: svscan checks for log directory instead of sticky bit. tnx
		many people.
20010709
	ui: added pgrphack.
20010710
	internal: upgraded to latest installation system.
20010711
	version: daemontools 0.75, beta.
20010712
	internal: ./package/compile creates ./compile/home.
	internal: ./package/compile creates absolute ./compile/src
		symlink instead of using .., so ./compile can itself be
		a symlink. tnx Paul Jarc.
	portability problem: Solaris sh has a built-in test that doesn't
		support -e, even though the test program supports -e.
		impact: package/{compile,run,upgrade} fail. tnx Mate
		Wierdl. fix: use -d, -h, -r.
	version: daemontools 0.76, beta.
